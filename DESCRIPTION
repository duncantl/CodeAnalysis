Package: CodeAnalysis
Title: Tools for Static Analysis of R code
Version: 0.1-1
Description: This package provides a (growing) collection of 
 functions that analyze R code and identify particular idioms
 or characteristics. Some of these functions modify the code
 to produce more streamlined version. 
 The package is motivated by compilation of R code and 
 simplifying code ahead of compilation. 
 However, the functionality may be useful generally for improving R code
 and diagnosing issues, and also in other contexts such as dynamic documents.
 We will continue to add functionality to analyze code for different purposes, 
 e.g. memory management, 
      opportunities for parallelism, 
      data locality for parallel computations, ...
 Currently, there is functionality to 
   *  find unused parameters/arguments
   *  find unused variables/assignments
   *  identify constant parameters (i.e. unchanged in the function's body)
   *  detect vector concatenation in loops
   *  identify & remove dead code (after a call to return())
   *  remove dead if/else code blocks (i.e. where we are certain the condition is TRUE or FALSE)
