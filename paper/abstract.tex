Code analysis tools are common in software engineering but less so for dynamic, interactive
languages such as \R.  We describe many useful applications of static code analysis for querying,
understanding, simplifying, improving and refactoring R code and introduce the \R package
\pkg{CodeAnalysis} which provides functionality implementing these utilities.  Importantly, these
analysis tools are implemented in \R itself and are customizable and extensible rather than as
internal elements of other projects (e.g. compilers).  The package leverages the \pkg{rstatic} and
\pkg{CodeDepends} packages as general infrastructure for code analysis, and wWe hope these foster
further development of additional code analysis tools in the \R community.
