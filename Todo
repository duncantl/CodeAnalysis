+ findFunctionDefs() doesn't handle  name = name2 = function() ...
   + only captures name and not name2
   + RDCOMEvents/eventServer.S

+ fix callGraph(fun) and the name used is obj.

+ implement findOS()/mkOSWalker for finding code that depends on the platform/OS

+ If a function has a literal extrernalptr inlined, then getGlobals() fails in lapply(els, fun, w)

+ Fix mkGlobalsLocal() to optionally not add a default value to a parameter
   e.g. not replace Jvar with .Jvar = Jvar

+ Have mkGlobalsLocal() return the entire list, not just the ones that were changed.
   Make this an option.

+ mkGlobalsLocal() not changing references inside return() clause. See rstatic probably.


for loop concatenation, rewrite the code.
  We need type information about the elements to be able to initialize the answer vector.

[Done] removeAfterReturn  should work recursively to process blocks within functions.

[Done] remove unused parameters

[Done] remove unused assignments if we can tell there are no side effects of the RHS.
