## Abstract

In this paper we demonstrate new opportunities to apply code analysis
to the R language. Many of these have not been explored before by the
R community. These analyses can help us both understand our R code
better and improve the performance.

We hope the prototypes we present here will motivate members of the
community to develop a more robust set of tools for code analysis.
