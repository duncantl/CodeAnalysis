Introduction
============

Where possible, we would like to transform loops in R into an apply style call. This is
valuable because it's easier to a) understand and reason about the body of the loop,
and b) subsequently run the loop in parallel (e.g. with mclapply()).

Suppose we start with this code:

ans = rep(NA, length.out = length(x))
for(i in seq_along(x)) {
   ans[i] = f(x[i])
}

Then we would like to transform it to this:

ans = sapply(x, f)

This sapply() version is idiomatic R. In contrast, the following is truly
iterative code which cannot be naturally converted to an apply style
function, because the output of each iteration depends on the previous
iteration.
<!-- need to define estimate first. More context would be good. -->
for(i in 1:n) {
   estimate = update(estimate)
}

It could happen that someone who is familiar with idiomatic R writes
something in a complex for loop, because it's not immediately obvious that
it can be put in the form of an apply function. Then the code analysis
methods should be capable of pointing this out.

This technique could also be applied as part of a series of code processing
steps. For example, we could first fuse multiple loops using Ulle's
RLoopFusion package, then transform them into an apply version, and then
transform into a parallel version.

Method
=======

The simplest case is when every iteration only depends on the index
variable, ie. the `i` in `for(i in seq_along(x))`. This is the case for the
example above, where each assignment is into `ans[i]`. More generally, if
the only assignments in the body of the loop are to unique addresses then
it can be transformed.
