chp1.Muaggregate.by.year.R taken from Scott Devine's  [GreenWater repository](https://github.com/dsidavis/GreenWater) repository
and specifically the Analysis/chp1.Muaggregate.by.year.R file. (Copied to here for convenience.)


The purpose of this is to take a script and find the expressions that read data.
We can then examine those to see how we might modify/rewrite them to read the data in chunks
that can be run in parallel.

This also relates to finding input and output files in [file dependencies](../file_dep)
explorations.
