    # output = parallel::mclapply(1:500, function(...) g())

    # lapply, something like:
    lapply1 = parse(text = "
    output = lapply(1:500, function(i) {
        tmp = g()

    # Approaches 2 and 3 have the advantage of allowing for the iterator to
    # NOT be a simple sequence, and they should still match the result of
    # the for loop. I think I'll go with this way.

    # Unless we can reliably differentiate vectors and lists based on
    # static analysis I think we should just default to a list. The use of
    # `[[` usually means it's a list, even though it works with vectors.

    # Just thought of another perversion. What if the user redefines the
    # iterator variable inside the loop?
    # for(i in 1:n){
    #   i = ...
    # Ack!
